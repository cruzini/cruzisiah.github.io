**Overview**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computers to extract meaning from human language (i.e. an NLP model can analyze thousands of tweets about a concert and return what the most common 'sentiment' about the concert was). 

**History**

NLP originates from the intersection of the fields of linguistics (the study of language) and computer science (the study of computers) â€” with Alan Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" being pointed to as the starting point in 1950.

**Use Cases**

There are several different types of NLP, including semantic analysis, syntactic analysis, speech-to-text, machine translation, and more. The most common are syntactic analysis (a rules-based approach that takes meaning from text according to grammatical structure) and semantic analysis (a context-based approach that takes meaning from text according to words, sentence structure, and labeling). Other use cases like speech-to-text (converting human language in audio form into readable text) and relationship extraction (detecting relationships between people or organizations using classification algorithms) are less common but nevertheless powerful in what they are capable of.

**Code Packages**
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):

Capabilities- Tokenization, Part of Speech tagging (POS), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Stopwords, etc.

Other NLP code packages:
* spaCy
* TextBlob
* PyTorch-NLP
* And more...

**Conclusion**
 The subsequent blog posts will explore several tools in the larger NLP framework. Each of these tools are part of NLP's "magic", which is to translate vast amounts of unstructured and structured human language into numerical components that can be digested by a computer to extract meaning and value from text.
